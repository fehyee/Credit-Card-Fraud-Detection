# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
## BUILDING, TRAINING, AND EVALUATION
When discussing security in digital life, the main challenge is finding abnormal activities. As we move into a digital world, the need for a system that can track the pattern of all the transactions including aborting abnormal transactions arises.

The model was built using a dataset containing the actual bank transactions made by European cardholders in 2013. The dataset was an imbalanced one which was balanced using the random under-sampling technique.

The dataset was collected, preprocessed, and analyzed. The model was built using the Logistic Regression Algorithm.
